# Experiment–3  
## Lists in Python: Indexing, Slicing, and List Methods

### Aim
To understand Python lists and perform operations such as indexing, slicing, traversal, and using built-in list methods.

### Objectives
- Create and access lists  
- Perform indexing and slicing operations  
- Apply commonly used list methods  
- Understand the mutable nature of lists  
- Traverse and modify lists  

### Theory

#### Introduction to Lists
A **list** is a built-in Python data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are written using square brackets `[]` and are flexible and dynamic.

#### Characteristics of Lists
- **Ordered** – Maintains insertion order  
- **Indexed** – Index starts from 0  
- **Mutable** – Elements can be changed  
- **Heterogeneous** – Stores different data types  
- **Allows Duplicates**

#### List Creation
Lists can be created using:
- Square brackets `[]`
- `list()` constructor  
Lists can also be **nested**.

#### Indexing
- **Positive Indexing:** Left to right (0, 1, 2, …)  
- **Negative Indexing:** Right to left (-1, -2, …)

#### Slicing
Used to extract a portion of a list.

**Syntax:**  
`list_name[start : end : step]`

Slicing does not modify the original list.

#### Mutability of Lists
Lists are mutable, allowing:
- Updating elements  
- Adding elements  
- Removing elements  

#### List Traversal
Traversal means accessing elements one by one using:
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  

#### List Methods
Commonly used list methods include:
- `append()`  
- `insert()`  
- `remove()`  
- `pop()`  
- `sort()`  
- `reverse()`  
- `clear()`  
- `count()`  
- `index()`

#### Built-in Functions for Lists
- `len()` – Number of elements  
- `max()` – Maximum value  
- `min()` – Minimum value  
- `sum()` – Sum of elements
