# Experiment 17: Statistical and Specialized Data Visualization Techniques
---

## 1. Aim
To explore and implement advanced statistical visualization techniques using Python libraries (**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**) to identify outliers, detect correlations, and visualize the distribution and composition of complex datasets.

## 2. Introduction to Libraries Used
Data visualization is a crucial step in data analysis that helps in understanding patterns, trends, and outliers. This experiment utilizes four fundamental Python libraries:

* **NumPy (`np`)**: Used for numerical computing and generating synthetic data (arrays and random numbers).
* **Pandas (`pd`)**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, specifically through its DataFrame object which organizes data into a 2D tabular format.
* **Matplotlib (`plt`)**: The foundational plotting library in Python, used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* **Seaborn (`sns`)**: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## 3. Data Generation and Manipulation Functions
Before visualizing data, synthetic datasets were generated using the following functions:

* `np.random.seed(seed_value)`: Ensures reproducibility. It initializes the random number generator so that the same sequence of random numbers is produced every time the code is run.
* `np.random.randint(low, high, size)`: Generates an array of random integers between the specified `low` (inclusive) and `high` (exclusive) bounds.
* `pd.DataFrame({...})`: Constructs a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure containing labeled axes (rows and columns).
* `np.where(condition, x, y)`: Returns elements chosen from `x` or `y` depending on the condition. It functions like a vectorized if-else statement (used here to assign 'Approved' or 'Rejected' loan statuses).
* `df.corr()`: A Pandas DataFrame method that computes the pairwise correlation of columns, excluding NA/null values. It defaults to the Pearson correlation coefficient.
* `df.head()`: Returns the first 5 rows of the DataFrame, useful for quickly verifying the dataset structure.

## 4. Plotting and Visualization Functions

### General Matplotlib Configurations
* `plt.figure(figsize=(width, height))`: Creates a new figure object. The `figsize` parameter controls the dimensions of the plot in inches.
* `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`: Used to add a descriptive title and label the x and y axes, respectively.
* `plt.show()`: Renders and displays the constructed plot to the screen.
* `plt.legend()`: Places a legend on the axes to identify different data series.

### A. Area Plot* `plt.fill_between(x, y1, y2=0, ...)`: Fills the area between two horizontal curves. In this experiment, it is used to shade the region between the x-axis and the data points, creating an area plot.
    * **Parameters used:** `color` specifies the fill color, and `alpha` controls the transparency (0.0 to 1.0) so overlapping areas remain visible.

### B. Pie and Donut Charts


* `plt.pie(x, ...)`: Plots a pie chart where the fractional area of each wedge is given by `x/sum(x)`.
    * **Parameters used:** `labels` assigns names to wedges, `autopct` formats the percentage values overlaid on the slices (e.g., `'%1.2f%%'` for two decimal places), and `explode` offsets specific slices from the center for emphasis.



**Donut Chart Implementation:** Matplotlib does not have a native donut chart function. It is created by drawing a standard pie chart and then overlaying a white/colored circle in the center.
* `Circle((x, y), radius, fc)`: Creates a circular patch.
* `plt.gcf().gca().add_artist(circle)`: Gets the current figure (`gcf`), gets the current axes (`gca`), and adds the circle patch to the plot, masking the center of the pie chart.

### C. Boxplot (Outlier Detection)


* `sns.boxplot(x=...)` / `plt.boxplot(...)`: Draws a box plot to show distributions with respect to categories. It visualizes the five-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum) and helps in visually identifying outliers (plotted as individual points beyond the "whiskers").

### D. Heatmap (Correlation Matrix)

* `sns.heatmap(data, ...)`: Plots rectangular data as a color-encoded matrix. Highly effective for visualizing correlation matrices.
    * **Parameters used:** `annot=True` writes the data value in each cell, and `cmap` specifies the colormap (e.g., `'coolwarm'`) to visually distinguish between positive, negative, and neutral correlations.

### E. Bubble Plot (Advanced Scatter)

A bubble plot is an extension of a scatter plot where a third dimension of data is represented by the size of the markers.
* `plt.scatter(x, y, s, c, ...)`: Draws a scatter plot.
    * **Parameters used:** `s` dictates the size of the marker (creating the "bubble"), `c` dictates the color, `cmap` applies a colormap to the values, and `alpha` adds transparency.
* `plt.colorbar()`: Adds a color scale next to the plot to map the colors of the bubbles to their corresponding numerical values.
* `sns.scatterplot(..., size, hue, sizes, palette)`: The Seaborn equivalent, which handles legends and scaling automatically. `size` maps the bubble sizes to a variable, and `hue` maps colors to a variable.

### F. Histogram

* `plt.hist(x, bins, ...)`: Computes and draws the histogram of array `x`. It groups numerical data into continuous intervals (bins) to visualize the underlying frequency distribution.
    * **Parameters used:** `bins` defines the number of equal-width bins, `color` fills the bars, and `edgecolor` outlines the bars for better visibility.
      
### 5. Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates how specialized plots go beyond simple trend analysis to provide deep statistical insights. By utilizing **Boxplots** for cleaning data (outliers) and **Heatmaps** for feature selection (correlation), we can make more informed data-driven decisions. Seaborn proves to be an essential tool for creating these aesthetically pleasing and mathematically rigorous visualizations with minimal code.
